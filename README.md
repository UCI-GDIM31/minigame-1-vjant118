## Devlog
Imagine you are a baker making cakes to sell. The basic assembly that every sees are the layers of cake, frostings, and toppings, however in order to make those parts you need raw ingredients. For the actual cake you need flour, eggs, sugar. For frostings you need powdered sugar and any other colorings. The basic ingredients are components, the properties that make up the assembly parts or GameObjects. One batter can have chocoate in it with extra flour while an object has the component of being a collectable or a hazard. Once you have your baked cakes and frostings, or platforms and hazards, you can assemble into the cake or Scene that holds everything you built.
